# Direct Modification of Instance Variables in Ruby

This example showcases a common, yet subtle, error in Ruby: directly manipulating instance variables outside of the class's defined methods.  While seemingly innocuous in small programs, this practice can lead to unforeseen problems, especially in larger, more complex applications.

The `bug.rb` file demonstrates how directly using `instance_variable_set` to modify the `@value` instance variable bypasses the intended object interface, potentially breaking encapsulation and making code harder to maintain and debug.

The `bugSolution.rb` file offers a more robust solution, adhering to proper object-oriented principles. It provides an accessor method (`value=`) to ensure controlled modification of the instance variable.

**Key takeaway**:  Always favor using accessor methods (getters and setters) to interact with an object's internal state.  This enhances code readability, maintainability, and helps prevent unexpected side effects.
